Sample LinkedList
11 -> 3 -> -23 -> 7
We will try to append a new node 4 to the list

Appending and removing from tail
    Appending will be O(1): constant time
    Removing will take O(N): Linear time

Appending and removing from head
    Appending will take O(1): constant
    Removing will also take O(1): constant

Adding item somewhere in the middle of list
    Adding 4 after 23 node
        pointer to iterate through list until you get to the 23 node
        set 4.next to pointer.next
        set pointer.next to 4
        This will take O(N): linear
    Removing 4
        pointer to iterate until 4
        set 23 pointer to 7
        set 4.next to None
        This will take O(N): Linear

Lookup 23
    pointer to iterate through list until 23
    This will take O(N): Linear
